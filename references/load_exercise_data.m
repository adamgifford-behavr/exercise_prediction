% This file has *only* data during exercises, already separated out by exercise.
% The "singleonly" in the filename means that it only contains "single-activity" traces.
% So this is useful for the "which exercise?" (recognition) and counting problems, not for
% the "when is there exercise?" problem.
dataFileSingleActivity = fullfile(dataBaseDir,'exercise_data.50.0000_singleonly.mat');

% This file has data from complete exercise sessions, so it includes lots of time
% where there's no execise happening.  The "multionly" in the filename means that it
% only contains "multi-activity" traces.  So this is useful for the "when are you
% exercising?"  problem (segmentation).
dataFileMultiActivity = fullfile(dataBaseDir,'exercise_data.50.0000_multionly.mat');

% We separate these into two files to make it a little easier to work on
% one problem or the other.  You can completely reconstruct the
% "single-activity" file *from* the "multi-activity" file, because it also
% includes all the times at which each exercise started and stopped.

% In this file, we're going to play around with data from a particular
% subject doing a particular exercise.  Not every subject did every
% exercise; I'm picking a combination that I happen to know isn't empty.
% In fact I'm also picking a subject that I happen to know participated
% more than once.

% Both of these files have similar formats format... the data lives in a cell
% matrix called "subject_data", where each row is a subject, and each column
% is a type of exercise.
%
% In the "multi-activity" data, there's only one column, since we haven't separated
% data out into exercises yet.

% The column names for the single-activity data are here:
activities = exerciseDataSingleActivity.exerciseConstants.activities';
nActivityTypes = length(activities);

% Sanity-check our data matrices

%% Find the column for a particular exercise we want to look at

exerciseIndex = find(strcmp(exerciseDataSingleActivity.exerciseConstants.activities,...
    exerciseName));


%% This matrix has one row per person, one column per exercise

% Any given cell in "subject_data" is a struct array, with one element for
% each time that subject (this row) performed that exercise (this column)
%
% So for example, the following cell contains a struct array, with one element per
% record, of every time this subject came in to our lab and did the exercise we picked
% above, which may span multiple visits.
recordings = exerciseDataSingleActivity.subject_data{iSubject,exerciseIndex};

% How many times did this subject do this particular exercise?
nRecordings = length(recordings);


%% Now let's look at one instance of this particular subject doing this particular exercise

% Arbitrarily grab the first instance to plot
recording = recordings(1);
assert(strcmp(recording.activityName,exerciseName));

% Plot the raw accelerometer and gyro data (at 50Hz)

ylabel('Gyro output (dps)');
legend({'X','Y','Z'});


%% Now let's play around with the multi-activity data

% Remember, in this file, we haven't separated out the periods of exercise
% and non-exercise, everything is one big long trace per subject, with
% labels to tell us where exercises started and stopped.

recordings = exerciseDataMultiActivity.subject_data{iSubject,1};

% Each instance here represents a visit to our lab
nVisits = length(recordings);

% Arbitrarily grab the first visit
recording = recordings(1);

% This is a cell matrix that tells us when exercises started and stopped,
% and how many repetitions the subject did for each exercise.  The columns
% are:
%
% [exercise name],[start time],[end time],[notes],[number of repetitions]

% So let's plot this subject's accelerometer data (just one axis, so the plot
% doesn't get too complex), with vertical lines to indicate where exercises
% started, with labels for each exercise.
nActivities = size(recording.activityStartMatrix,1);

accelT = recording.data.accelDataMatrix(:,1);
accelZ = recording.data.accelDataMatrix(:,4);
