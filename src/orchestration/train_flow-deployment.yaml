### A complete description of a Prefect Deployment for flow 'Model Training'
###
name: Exercise Group-Naive Features Predictions Training
description: |-
  This function loads the data, performs a search over the hyperparameters using hyperopt,
  and then trains the best model on the training data and tests it on the test data.
  Finally, it compares the best model from this training to the existing model in
  production (if one exists) and registers and promotes the model to staging if either
  no production model exists or the new model has a better accuracy.

  Args:
    table_name (str): the name of the table in the database that contains the data
    label_col (str): the name of the column in the data that contains the labels
    model_search_json (str): This is the path to the JSON file that contains the model
    name, fixed parameters, and search parameters. Defaults to ./model_search.json
    initial_points_json (Optional[str]): This is the path to the JSON file that
    contains starting points for hyperparameter values for fitting procedure (e.g., to
    use values from previous fit to potentially speed up fitting). Defaults to None
